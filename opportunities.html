          <p>As a pretty new technology, one big point people care about is the job market. How is blockchain’s job market, what can people do in this field and does it deserve to learn and apply as a job? Let’s take a look at them.</p>
          <p>From the graph, we can see people’s interests are rising to peak in 2017 and that’s the highest point for blockchain. The rise of blockchain leads to the rise of blockchain jobs. The numbers don’t lie and some numbers are truly staggering. According to Indeed’s statistics, jobs on blockchain has increased 206% in 2016. It makes cryptocurrency jobs hot as well. Many big industries are desperately looking for high-quality talent which is extremely limited in this field. In 2018, we can see the overall market cap for bitcoins and other cryptocurrency. But blockchain is still in its high demand.</p>
          <p>It’s easy to find jobs about blockchain online. But what career options do people have in this field? We can see from the image that technical engineering positions are always leading, but there are also many for design, operation, business, management and so on. There are multiple reasons to choose blockchain for the career. Compared with other technique jobs, blockchain jobs offer a 10%-20% higher rate as it’s a new field and not many people have its knowledge. Working remotely is also easier to accept from the company and it’s faster to accumulate knowledge in this field which provides a better start in career path(Rebecca Koenig). To be a developer or engineer, you need to know about Ethereum or other smart contract platform, Solidity programing language and other blockchain core knowledge. To be a non-tech person like operation, management or business, basically you need to know about the blockchain technology. A lot of big companies are hiring blockchain positions like IBM, Microsoft and VISA. And there are also some new bitcoin startups which are also good options. For those who want to learn and try something new, this is a good opportunity.</p>
