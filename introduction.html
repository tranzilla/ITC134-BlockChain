        <p>Blockchain is the most revolutionary technology since Marc Andreessen introduced us to the World Wide Web with Mosaic, the first internet browser (Marc Andreessen).  It will challenge conventions in nearly every industry and disrupt business as usual in orders of magnitude not seen before. It will transform business on the internet and world wide web. There are risks, and these will be mitigated in the same fashion that organizations address other risks in technology and other aspects of business.</p>
        <p>What is blockchain, what makes it so potentially power and transformative? Where did it come from? What are the current corporate directives?  What’s in it for college grads? What are the employment opportunities? Why are all your friends and family talking about it?</p>
        <p>According to CNBC.com, “Blockchain is one of the biggest buzzwords in technology right now. But what is it? To most of us, blockchain is a mysterious technology associated with cryptocurrency such as bitcoin.  And in fact,the first blockchain was conceptualized and implemented was Bitcon, implemented in 2008. However, the first paper on cryptographically secured chain of blocks dates back to 1991.</p>
        <p>With our current understanding, blockchain seems mysterious, but with two words we can make blockchain easily understood and remove the mystery. In short, blockchains are simply transaction ledgers linked together on the internet</p>
