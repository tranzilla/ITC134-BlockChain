        <p>The world is changing rapidly. The impact of technology is seen all around us. The Internet was first implemented in the 1970’s. Andreessen brought the internet to life with the first web browser introducing us to the World Wide Web in 1994 (Marc Andreessen). Today we have technology at our fingertips with everything from shopping to music. Blockchain is about to take us on the next phase of innovation. Hang on!
